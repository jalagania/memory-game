# Frontend Mentor - Memory game solution

### Expected behaviour

- In a solo game, track the time elapsed since first clicking on a tile and the total number of moves made. A move counts as two tiles being selected as a potential match. Once all pairs have been found, stop the timer and show the end of game modal with the stats.
- In a multiplayer game, track the total number of pairs each player has found. If a player finds a pair, increment their score by one. The current turn switches to the next player after the current player has made a move to find a potential match.
- Clicking "Restart" will restart the game with the current settings
